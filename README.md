How to build docker image:

Create a docker file and add this code

- Use a base Python image
  
FROM python:3.8-slim

- Install system dependencies
  
RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y libpq-dev

- Install Python dependencies
  
COPY requirements.txt /app/
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

- Copy the application into the container

COPY . /app/

- Define an environment variable for Flask

  
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

- Create the database and apply migrations (if necessary)

  
RUN flask db init
RUN flask db migrate
RUN flask db upgrade

- Run the application

  
CMD ["flask", "run"]


NB: You don't need to set export FLASK_APP= since I did it myself. You only need to install python-dotenv (requirements.txt)
